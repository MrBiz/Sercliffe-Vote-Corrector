# Sercliffe-Vote-Corrector
Code to increment the counts of Sercliffe voting machines to favor one political party over the others.
We were forced to write this code to "hack" the r/Sercliffe voting machines to favor one political party over the others. 
I'm putting the code on Github so that there is a record of the treachery against the great nation of r/Sercliffe.

They threatened my family y'all.
I'm going into hiding now, see you in the next life
